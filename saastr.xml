      <title>Dear SaaStr:  Why Do Enterprise Customers Insist on Pilots? (翻訳失敗)</title>
      <link>https://www.saastr.com/dear-saastr-why-do-enterprise-customers-insist-on-pilots/</link>
      <description>Enterprise customers often insist on pilots before committing to a full deal with SaaS companies. Pilots help mitigate risks by allowing customers to test the product before a full rollout, reducing perceived risks and building trust. They demonstrate the tangible value of the product, showing measurable outcomes like efficiency improvements or cost savings. Pilots also allow for customization and fit assessment within the client&apos;s workflows, leading to smoother implementations. Additionally, pilots help build internal buy-in within the client&apos;s organization and provide hands-on experience with the product, aiding in faster decision-making and accelerating the sales cycle.

SaaS companies should embrace pilots as they can lead to more closed deals, despite the initial extra effort required. Setting clear success criteria upfront is crucial for a successful pilot, ensuring both parties agree on the expected outcomes. By focusing on the benefits of pilots and effectively managing them, SaaS companies can increase their chances of converting pilots into long-term contracts and building strong relationships with enterprise clients.
