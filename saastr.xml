      <title>Dear SaaStr:  Why Do Enterprise Customers Insist on Pilots? (翻訳失敗)</title>
      <link>https://www.saastr.com/dear-saastr-why-do-enterprise-customers-insist-on-pilots/</link>
      <description>The article discusses why enterprise customers often insist on pilots before committing to SaaS deals, despite the extra work involved for sales teams. Pilots help mitigate risks by allowing customers to test products, demonstrate value through measurable outcomes, assess customization needs, build internal buy-in, provide hands-on experience, and expedite decision-making. To succeed with pilots, SaaS companies should focus on setting clear success criteria upfront with clients to avoid prolonged evaluations. Embracing and excelling at pilots can lead to more closed deals, especially with risk-averse enterprise customers. It is emphasized that even though pilots require more effort initially, they can ultimately streamline the sales process and increase conversion rates. SaaS businesses are advised to understand the benefits of pilots and invest in making them successful to drive growth and build trust with enterprise clients. (翻訳失敗)</description>
