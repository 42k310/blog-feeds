      <title>Dear SaaStr:  Why Do Enterprise Customers Insist on Pilots? (翻訳失敗)</title>
      <link>https://www.saastr.com/dear-saastr-why-do-enterprise-customers-insist-on-pilots/</link>
      <description>Pilots are crucial for SaaS companies when dealing with enterprise customers. They help mitigate risks by allowing customers to test the product, demonstrate its value, assess customization needs, build internal support, provide hands-on experience, and expedite decision-making. Despite the extra effort required to sell during and after a pilot, they are often necessary for enterprise clients to trust and adopt new solutions, especially from smaller vendors. Setting clear success criteria upfront is essential for a successful pilot, ensuring both parties agree on the expected outcomes. Embracing and excelling at pilots can lead to more closed deals, as they address key concerns and requirements of enterprise customers. SaaS companies should focus on structuring pilots properly, showcasing measurable outcomes, and aligning with clients on success metrics to maximize the effectiveness of these trials.
