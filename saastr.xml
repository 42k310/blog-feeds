      <title>Dear SaaStr:  Why Do Enterprise Customers Insist on Pilots? (翻訳失敗)</title>
      <link>https://www.saastr.com/dear-saastr-why-do-enterprise-customers-insist-on-pilots/</link>
      <description>The article discusses why enterprise customers insist on pilots when considering new solutions from SaaS companies. Pilots help mitigate risks by allowing customers to test products before committing fully, showcasing tangible value, fitting into specific workflows, building internal buy-in, providing hands-on experience, and expediting decision-making. While pilots may seem like a hassle for sales teams, they can actually streamline the sales process by addressing customer concerns upfront. To succeed with pilots, it&apos;s crucial to establish clear success criteria with clients to ensure both parties are aligned on expected outcomes. Embracing pilots and excelling at them can lead to more closed deals, especially with risk-averse enterprise clients. Therefore, SaaS companies should invest time and effort in mastering the pilot process to increase their chances of converting pilot projects into long-term contracts. (翻訳失敗)</description>
