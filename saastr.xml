      <title>Dear SaaStr:  Why Do Enterprise Customers Insist on Pilots? (翻訳失敗)</title>
      <link>https://www.saastr.com/dear-saastr-why-do-enterprise-customers-insist-on-pilots/</link>
      <description>The article discusses why enterprise customers insist on pilots when considering new SaaS solutions. Pilots help mitigate risk by allowing customers to test the product before committing fully, reducing the perceived risk of adoption. They also provide proof of value by demonstrating tangible outcomes like efficiency gains or cost savings. Pilots allow for customization and fit assessment, enabling clients to see how the product integrates with their workflows. Additionally, pilots aid in building internal buy-in within the client&apos;s organization, as stakeholders and end-users can experience the product firsthand.

The article emphasizes that despite the additional effort required for pilots, they can lead to faster decision-making and ultimately more closed deals. To succeed with pilots, setting clear success criteria upfront is crucial to avoid prolonged evaluations with uncertain outcomes. SaaS companies are encouraged to embrace pilots as a strategic tool for building trust, demonstrating value, and accelerating sales cycles in the enterprise market. (翻訳失敗)</description>
