      <title>Dear SaaStr:  Why Do Enterprise Customers Insist on Pilots? (翻訳失敗)</title>
      <link>https://www.saastr.com/dear-saastr-why-do-enterprise-customers-insist-on-pilots/</link>
      <description>Enterprise customers often insist on pilots before committing to a full SaaS product rollout. Pilots help mitigate risks, demonstrate value, customize solutions, gain internal buy-in, provide hands-on experience, and accelerate decision-making. While pilots may require selling the deal twice, they can lead to more closed deals with larger enterprises. To succeed with pilots, set clear success criteria upfront to ensure both parties agree on what success looks like, whether it&apos;s a specific ROI or user adoption rate. Embrace pilots as an opportunity to showcase the benefits of your product and address any customization needs early on. By mastering the art of pilots, SaaS companies can increase their chances of converting enterprise customers and building long-lasting relationships. (翻訳失敗)</description>
