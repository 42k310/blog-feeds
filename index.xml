      <title>Can You Sell Your Startup Below the Last Round Price?  Probably.  It?s More Common Today. (????)</title>

      <description>The article discusses a shift in the venture capital landscape, noting that despite the rise of unicorns and VC investments, there is now more flexibility from VCs on selling. It highlights the acquisition of Loom by Atlassian for $975 million, which was below its last round valuation of $1.53 billion led by Andreessen Horowitz. Despite the lower acquisition price, Andreessen Horowitz only managed to recoup their initial investment (1x return) but agreed to the sale without any issues. This example showcases how VCs are becoming more open to exits that may not meet the initial high valuation expectations. It suggests that in today&apos;s competitive market, VCs are willing to adapt and be more flexible with their exit strategies to ensure successful outcomes for both investors and startups.

      <link>https://www.saastr.com/dear-saastr-how-do-i-become-a-better-sdr-2/</link>
      <description>To become a better Sales Development Representative (SDR), focus on mastering your product and market by understanding how your product solves prospects&apos; problems. Know your target personas deeply to address their pain points effectively. Craft personalized, value-driven cold emails instead of using generic templates. Concentrate on creating opportunities rather than worrying about deal closures. Utilize technology and data to sound smart and target qualified leads efficiently. Maintain passion, hustle, and authenticity in your outreach. Personalize your communication by leveraging personal networks and customer stories. Learn from feedback, iterate, and refine your approach continuously. Respect the SDR role as it is crucial in any sales organization. Keep stakeholders informed and engaged. By excelling in these areas, you will not only improve as an SDR but also become invaluable to your team, leading to potential promotions and career growth opportunities. (????)</description>
